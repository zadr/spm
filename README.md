# spm

A wrapper around the parts of Swift package management that I can never keep straight

#### Documentation
The following commands will help get started on a new project
```
% spm app # this makes a new app for you
% spm binary # this makes a new command line tool for you
```

And from there, these commands might help as progress happens
```
% spm gen # make an xcodeproj
% spm build # build the thing
% spm fetch # this updates the package and downloads everything
% spm run # build and run the thing
```

Here are all the aliases available:
```
